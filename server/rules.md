# Zally Rule Sets

Zally comes with a number of Rule Sets which can be selected and used. The built in rule sets are documented below.

# InternalRuleSet

Internal rules which exist simply for the purpose of reporting fatal
errors found while attempting to parse the API specification.
The rules cannot be disabled or configured.

# ZalandoRuleSet

Primarily Zally exists to enforce the various guidelines of the [Zalando RESTful API and Event Scheme Guidelines](http://zalando.github.io/restful-api-guidelines/). Individual rules descriptions won't be repeated here.

# SBBRuleSet

We have added an SBB specific RuleSet which checks the compliance of the rules compared to [SBB's API Principles](https://schweizerischebundesbahnen.github.io/api-principles/).

# ZallyRuleSet

Zally also contains some additional rules enforcing aspects of the OpenAPI spec or other common sense rules that don't form part of the Zalando guidelines. Those addiitonal rules are documented here.

## M008: Host should not contain protocol

Information about protocol should be placed in schema and not as part of the host.

## M009: At most one body parameter

Enforces that "there can only be one body parameter" per operation as required by the [swagger spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#parameter-object).

## M010: Check case of various terms

Enforced that various terms match case requirements configured via
CaseChecker section in rules-config.conf.

Supports:

- schema property names
- query parameter names
- path parameter names
- tag names

## M011: Checks that all operations are tagged

Tags are often used to group operations together in generated
documentation and so it's useful to ensure that all operations are
properly tagged. This rule ensures that:

- All operations have at least one tag
- All tags are defined in the top level `tags:` section
  (defining order of groups)
- All defined tags are used
- All defined tags have a description

## S005: Do not leave unused definitions

Unused definitions cause confusion and should be avoided.

## S006: Define bounds for numeric properties

Numeric properties typically have bounds associated with them and these
should be expressed clearly in the API specification. If left
unspecified then the minimum or maximum will be defined by the
property's format (signed `int32` or `int64` for `integer` types,
`float` or `double` for `number` types).

## S007: Define maximum length for string properties

Implementations often have limits imposed on the length of strings and
these should be expressed clearly in the API specification. If left
unspecified then clients or servers may make inappropriate assumptions
and fail unexpectedly when supplied extra long strings.

## H001: Base path can be extracted

If all paths start with the same prefix then it would be cleaner to extract that into the basePath rather than repeating for each path.

## H002: Avoid `x-zally-ignore`

The `x-zally-ignore` extension should be used sparingly for temporary exceptional circumstances. Use encourages deviation from agreed standards. For longer term solutions please discuss disabling or adjusting the rule with your team.
