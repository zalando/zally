  title: Zally - Zalando's API Linter
  description: |
    Zally is a quality assurance tool. It's main purpose is to check the complience of
    API specifications to a specific set of API design rules.

    The service is able to lint the API specification in OpenAPI format. The result of
    the linting is a set of Violations. A violation contains information about the violated
    rule, its severity, and path of the violation in the specification document.

    The API also provides a result and statistics endpoint. It contains aggregated statics like
    the number of linting requests and the number of checked endpoints. Additionally, all
    linting results and the linted API specifications can be retrieved.

        API Violations
      description: |
        The API Violations endpoint validates given Swagger Specification
        against the rules defined in *Zalando* RESTful API Guidelines
        (http://zalando.github.io/restful-api-guidelines/).

        A successful response includes the list of violations grouped by
        the API Guidelines rules.

        If an api definition is supplied via url then any non-successful
        responses from that will be passed on. For example you may be
        using Zally without authentication but supply a password
        protected url and still get a `401 Unauthorized` response.
